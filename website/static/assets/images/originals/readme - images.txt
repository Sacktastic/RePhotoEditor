Originals
---------------------

The original jpgs from Alex.  Do not touch unless to convert and put into the Converted (png) folder.


Converted (png)
---------------------

The original jpgs but converted into the lossless png file.  This will prevent loss in quality when editing.  Everytime you save a jpg, the jpg is re-compressed, causing quality loss.  PNGs do not suffer the same way.

Copy the png into the Edited folder before editing to prevent duplication of work
